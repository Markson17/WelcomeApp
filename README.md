**1. Introduction:**
   - The assignment involved creating a simple mobile application using React Native that welcomes a user when they enter their name. The objective was to implement basic navigation between screens and demonstrate the use of user input and dynamic styling.

**2. Development Environment Setup:**
   - I set up my development environment by installing Node.js, npm (or yarn), and Expo CLI.
   - I used Expo CLI to create a new React Native project.

**3. Project Structure:**
   - The project structure consisted of several files and directories, including:
     - `App.js`: Main entry point of the application.
     - `HomeScreen.js`: Component for the home screen.
     - `WelcomeScreen.js`: Component for the welcome screen.
     - Other directories for assets, configurations, etc.

**4. Implementation Details:**

   **4.1 Home Screen:**
   - Implemented a simple form using TextInput to capture the user's name.
   - Implemented navigation to the Welcome Screen upon pressing the Enter button.
   
   **4.2 Welcome Screen:**
   - Displayed a welcoming message along with the user's name.
   - Utilized dynamic styling for the background color.

**5. Navigation Setup:**
   - Used React Navigation to set up navigation between screens.
   - Configured a Stack Navigator to handle navigation.

**6. Styling and Design:**
   - Chose vibrant colors for both screens to enhance visual appeal.
   - Used basic styling to ensure a clean and user-friendly interface.

**7. Testing and Debugging:**
   - Tested the application on both iOS and Android devices/emulators using Expo Go.
   - Resolved minor styling issues and ensured proper functionality.

**8. Building the APK:**
   - Used Expo CLI to build the APK for Android.
   - Followed the build process and downloaded the generated APK file.
   - Tested the APK on a physical Android device to verify functionality.

**9. Conclusion:**
   - Overall, the assignment provided a valuable opportunity to apply React Native concepts in a practical project.
   - I gained hands-on experience with navigation, user input, and dynamic styling in React Native.
   - The project helped solidify my understanding of mobile app development using React Native.
